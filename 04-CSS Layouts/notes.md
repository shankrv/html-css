# Layouts: Floats, Flexbox and CSS Grids

### 14.09.22

- Layout is the visual structure of a webpage where the contents are placed and arranged.
- Floats are not a positioning scheme like absolute position but can make elements out of flow.
- Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element unlike absolute position.
- CSS `box-sizing` property from `content-box` (initial) to `border-box` changes the CSS box-model rules.

### Best Practices

- `box-sizing: border-box` can be added as a declaration rule in the universal selector.
