# Responsive Web Design

### 16.10.22

- Media Queries are used to apply styles based on certain widths of the viewport
- Breakpoints are the viewport width (values) at which we want the design to change
- viewport `<meta>` tag is required to make webpage responsive on mobile devices
- `rem` and `em` do not depend on the html font-size in the media queries (=`16px`)
- attribute selectors `[name="value"]` are used to select elements based on attributes
- `display: none;` to hide the element, allows no transitions on the element at all
- we use the `opacity`, `pointer-events` and `visibility` as a workaround in such cases
