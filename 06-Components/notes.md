### 03.10.22, 05.10.22

Elements -> Components -> Layouts -> Webpage

- Accordion
- Carousel
- Table
- Pagination

### Best Practices

- `transform: scale(n);` is used to scale elements or images on a webpage.
- `transform: translate(h,v);` is used to move elements based on its own properties.
- `.btn:hover .btn-icon {}` is used to style a child element when parent has a special state.
- `.class-a.class-b {}` is the AND selector, applied when both classes exists on the same element.
