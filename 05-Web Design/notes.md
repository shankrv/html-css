Typography

- Typography is all about making texts beautiful and easy to read.
- Sans-Serif and Serif are the fonts widely used in the web world.

Colors

- Colors convey meaning and draws attention to the most imp. elements of a website.
- Hence the base color or the main color should always match a webiste's personailty.
- The color palette should have at least 2 type of colors - the main and the grey color.
- Accent color can also be added to the palette which is based on the main and grey color.
- The lighter versions of the color are called tints and darker versions are called shades.

Images/Illustrations

- Images are the most imp. content of a webpage - product photos, storytelling, illustrations and patterns.
- Its also used to support the website's message and story, so relevant and original images are preferred.
- We should use compressed version of the images to lower file size and better load performance.
- When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they should have the exact same dimensions.

### Best Practices

- The smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be applied.
- The images should be 2x or 3x of the visible display size for high-resolution screens.
