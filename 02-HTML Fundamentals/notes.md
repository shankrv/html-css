# HTML Fundamentals

### 16.01.22

- HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. It is a markup language and NOT a programming language
- Semantic HTML elements are elements that do have a meaning with respect to the content and not the looks
- Semantic elements are used for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) tools to analyze the content and accessibilty
- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>` are some of the semantic elements introduced in HTML5
- `<div>` is also a semantic element, but used when we don't want to attach a specific meaning to that element
- `&copy;` - is one of the HTML entities, or a special text used for a copyright symbol in an HTML document

##### Best Practices

- It's considered a good practice to have only one `<h1>` heading element in a single webpage
- Use `<strong>`, `<em>` instead of `<b>`, `<i>`, because they have a semantic meaning (HTML5)
