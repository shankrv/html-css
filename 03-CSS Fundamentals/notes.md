# CSS Fundamentals

### 10.09.22

- CSS or **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets describes the presentation of the HTML content.
- These can be included in the HTML document as inline(attributes), internal(tags) or external(files).
- A descendant selector `parent child {}` is the representation for styling a nested element.
- Colors are defined in RGB(0-255), RGBA(alpha/trans, 0-255,0-1) and hexadecimal(0-f) notations.

### Best Practices

- Its always ideal to use external CSS instead of internal or inline styles.
- Class selectors are preferred over Id selectors so that they can be re-used in future.
- Hexadecimal and RGBA notations are the widely used color definitions across.
